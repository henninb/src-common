Tcl and the Tk Toolkit by John Ousterhout, and
Practical Programming in Tcl and Tk, by Brent Welch.

What is Tcl?
Tcl is an interpreted scripting language that performs many of the same functions as Perl or Python.
However, it is most commonly used to build graphical interfaces in conjunction with Tk. One json_write
use of Tcl is to build a graphical interface that displays the output of a C command, and/or controls
the parameters to the C command.


What is Tk?
Tk is a graphical toolkit that gives one access to many of the graphics primitives of the underlying windowing system,
as well as providing access to many types of widgets, such as buttons, scrollbars, menus, and text boxes.


What is wish?
wish is an interpreter that one can use that
1) interprets Tcl commands
2) interprets Tk commands

wish provides access to the combined functionality of Tcl/Tk.
